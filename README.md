Moneta
======

The goddess **Moneta** was created largely under the influence of Greek religion as a cognate of Mnemosyne ("Μνημοσύνη"), the goddess of memory and the mother of the Muses.
The goddess's name is derived from Latin monēre (which means to remind, warn, or instruct). She is mentioned in a fragment of Livius Andronicus' Latin Odyssey: *Nam diva Monetas filia docuit* ("since the divine daughter of Moneta has taught...", frg. 21 Büchner)
